    What to do for today?
    <p>Place in the centre of the scene a triangular
      mesh of a cylinder. Beside its position each vertex should be provided
      with a normal vector. In addition to that specify material coefficients
      of the Phong illumination model for the object and a position of a
      single white point light source. Those parameters can be hardcoded
      but simple to change. When drawing each triangle projected on the
      screen, for each pixel determine it’s corresponding position on object’s
      surface, it’s normal vector and finally its colour calculated using Phong
      illumination model.</p>
      <p>
        Special care needs to be taken when interpolating 3D positions and
        normal vectors along the interior of a projected triangle. Also, the
        cylinder mesh needs to be generated by the program. Its parameters,
        such as radius or number of subdivisions, can be hardcoded but
        you should be able to easily change them. Additionally, to solve the
        visibility problem, the back face culling algorithm should be employed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a look at triangle mesh rasterization guidelines. You can, however,
      ignore discussion about the z-buffer algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
        What to change? 1. Rewrite matrix, vector etc. to only include the standard methods. Add translations to other functions.
        2. Zamienic z buffern= na back culling
        3. Dodac switch miedzy mesh a texture
